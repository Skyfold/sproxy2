1.90.1
======

  * Fixed headers processing. Wrong headers were making Chromium drop connection in HTTP/2.
    Firefox sometimes couldn't handle gzipped and chunked responses in HTTP/1.1.

  * After authenticating, redirect to original path with query parameters if
    method was GET.  Otherwise redirect to "/". Previously, when unauthenticated
    users click on "https://example.net/foo?bar", they are redirected to
    "https://example.net/foo" regardless of the method.



1.90.0 (Preview Release)
========================

Sproxy2 is overhaul of original [Sproxy](https://github.com/zalora/sproxy)
(see also [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sproxy)).
Here are the key differences (with Sproxy 0.9.8):

  * Sproxy2 can work with remote PostgreSQL database. Quick access to the database is essential
    as sproxy does it on every HTTP request. Sproxy2 pulls data into local SQLite3 database.

  * At this release Sproxy2 is compatible with Sproxy database with one exception:
    SQL wildcards are not supported for HTTP methods. E. i. you have to change '%' in
    the database to specific methods like GET, POST, etc.

  * OAuth2 callback URLs changed: Sproxy2 uses `/.sproxy/oauth2/:provider`,
    e. g. `/.sproxy/oauth2/google`. Sproxy used `/sproxy/oauth2callback` for Google
    and `/sproxy/oauth2callback/linkedin` for LinkedIn.

  * Sproxy2 does not allow login with email addresses not known to it.

  * Sproxy2: OAuth2 callback state is serialized, signed and passed base64-encoded.
    Of course it's used to verify the request is legit.

  * Sproxy2: session cookie is serialized, signed and sent base64-encoded.

  * Path `/.sproxy` belongs to Sproxy2 completely. Anything under this path is never passed to backends.

  * Sproxy2 supports multiple backends. Routing is based on the Host HTTP header.

  * Sproxy2 uses [WAI](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) / [Warp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp)
    for incoming connections. As a result Sproxy2 supports HTTP2.

  * Sproxy2 uses [HTTP Client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client) to talk to backends.
    As a result Sproxy2 reuses backend connections instead of closing them after each request to the backend.

  * Sproxy2 optionally supports persistent key again (removed in Sproxy 0.9.2).
    This can be used in load-balancing multiple Sproxy2 instances.

  * Configuration file has changed. It's still YAML, but some options are renamed, removed or added.
